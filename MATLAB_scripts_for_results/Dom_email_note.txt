Refer to main.mlx for using them. Not sure if the ‘convertResultsCsvToTabDelimited.m’ file is needed – it might be old.
Note: I think the files assume that they live in a directory called ‘MTurk’ which also has the following sub directory architecture:
‘PSHF_Humerus_Segmentation’
‘Batches’
‘[Batch_X_Date]’
‘tiff_images’
‘results’
input.csv’
